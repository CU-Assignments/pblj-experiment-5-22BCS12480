**Employee Management System**

This Java application allows users to:

Add an Employee: Store employee details (ID, Name, Designation, Salary) in a serialized file (employees.ser).

Display All Employees: Retrieve and show all employee records.

Exit: Close the application.

How It Works

Uses ObjectOutputStream for saving employees and ObjectInputStream for loading them.

Ensures data persistence by appending new records.

Implements exception handling for file operations.

A simple and efficient way to manage employees using Java serialization.

**Student Serialization System**

This Java program demonstrates object serialization and deserialization for a Student class.

Features:

Serialize a Student Object: Saves student details (ID, Name, GPA) into a file.

Deserialize and Display: Reads student data from the file and prints it.

How It Works:

Uses ObjectOutputStream to write a Student object to a file.

Uses ObjectInputStream to read the object from the file.

Implements exception handling for FileNotFoundException, IOException, and ClassNotFoundException to ensure error-free execution.

This program provides a simple way to persist and retrieve student data using Java serialization.
